Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\\nThe decline of the Roman Empire and that of its Chinese counterpart resulted in which of the following?\\nA.

Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after a defeat in an election, the Party expelled all non- Native-American members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Native Americans could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party\\'s nominees. Membership is currently confined to Native Americans. In every election since, the Party\\'s nominees have easily won election in the Sixth Congressional District, an area encompassing a large number of outlying reservations. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own \"Native American Power\" candidate for governor of South Dakota in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U.

He tried to put the statement from the painter into evidence but the defendant objected. Will the court sustain the company\\'s objection to the admission of the painter\\'s statements?\\nA. Yes, because the painter is not qualified to make such statements regarding non-painting duties.\\nB. Yes, because the painter is not a participant as a negligent party in the catastrophic mistake that occurred.\\nC. No, because the painter works for the same company as the negligent workers, and he made his statements within the scope and course of his employment.\\nD.

The women\\'s group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men\\'s club was subject to the state\\'s anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor\\'s office building, carrying signs that read, \"The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don\\'t vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney\\'s office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor\\'s official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:\"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual.

Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. The estates of the two decedents sued the company. Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?\\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\\nC.

Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\\nA. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the presidentÕs conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\\nC.

The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple.

The women\\'s group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men\\'s club was subject to the state\\'s anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club.

So don\\'t vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney\\'s office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him.

Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:\"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202.

Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\\nThe decline of the Roman Empire and that of its Chinese counterpart resulted in which of the following?\\nA.

Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party.

Membership is currently confined to Native Americans. In every election since, the Party\\'s nominees have easily won election in the Sixth Congressional District, an area encompassing a large number of outlying reservations.

Yes, because the painter is not qualified to make such statements regarding non-painting duties.\\nB. Yes, because the painter is not a participant as a negligent party in the catastrophic mistake that occurred.\\nC. No, because the painter works for the same company as the negligent workers, and he made his statements within the scope and course of his employment.\\nD.

The women\\'s group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men\\'s club was subject to the state\\'s anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor\\'s office building, carrying signs that read, \"The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don\\'t vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney\\'s office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor\\'s official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:\"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the holding of a meeting or assembly on any premises used for the discussion of subjects of general public interest. \"The federal district court will most likely avoid making a decision on the merits of the suit for declaratory judgment because\\nA. the case lacks adequate ripeness.\\nB. there is no case or controversy.\\nC. the relief sought is essentially for an advisory opinion.\\nD. the women\\'s group lacks standing.\\nAnswer:', \"Some homeless people started residing on a strip of land located under a bridge.

Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. The estates of the two decedents sued the company. Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?\\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\\nC.

Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\\nA. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the presidentÕs conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\\nC.

From a normative perspective, the concept serves to highlight good global norms. Human security often serves as an umbrella norm. Developing good global norms is not only important for moral and ethical reasons but also because they serve to enhance state and international society.\\nC. The development of the human security concept highlights the view that the threats to humans as well as to state entities are changing and increasing.

Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\\nThe decline of the Roman Empire and that of its Chinese counterpart resulted in which of the following?\\nA.

Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party.

The women\\'s group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men\\'s club was subject to the state\\'s anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor\\'s office building, carrying signs that read, \"The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don\\'t vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney\\'s office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor\\'s official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:\"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual.

Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\\nC.

Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\\nA. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the presidentÕs conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\\nC.

The painter declared, \"I knew they should have reinforced the standing wall better than they did! It is all their fault!\" It turned out that he was referring to co-workers employed by the same construction company. The owner filed suit for damages against the construction business. He tried to put the statement from the painter into evidence but the defendant objected. Will the court sustain the company\\'s objection to the admission of the painter\\'s statements?\\nA. Yes, because the painter is not qualified to make such statements regarding non-painting duties.\\nB. Yes, because the painter is not a participant as a negligent party in the catastrophic mistake that occurred.\\nC. No, because the painter works for the same company as the negligent workers, and he made his statements within the scope and course of his employment.\\nD. No, because the painter may testify as a subcontractor to what he observed while on the location.\\nAnswer:', 'A women\\'s action group attempted for many months, unsuccessfully, to reach an agreement with the local professional men\\'s club to admit women to membership. The women\\'s group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men\\'s club was subject to the state\\'s anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor\\'s office building, carrying signs that read, \"The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don\\'t vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney\\'s office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor\\'s official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:\"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the holding of a meeting or assembly on any premises used for the discussion of subjects of general public interest. \"The federal district court will most likely avoid making a decision on the merits of the suit for declaratory judgment because\\nA. the case lacks adequate ripeness.\\nB. there is no case or controversy.\\nC. the relief sought is essentially for an advisory opinion.\\nD. the women\\'s group lacks standing.\\nAnswer:', \"Some homeless people started residing on a strip of land located under a bridge. The land was owned by a nearby chemical manufacturer. The squatters did not ask permission, and the company did not feel it was an urgent problem. The squatters used a small lake on the property for bathing and drinking water. Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. The estates of the two decedents sued the company. Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?\\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\\nC. No, because owner owes no duty to trespassers except if it acts with willful or wanton disregard.\\nD. No, because an owner of land never has to worry about protecting the safety of trespassers.\\nAnswer:\", 'The president of a pharmaceutical firm received a report from his testing bureau that a manufactured lot of the firmÕs anticancer prescription medication was well below strength. Concerned about being able to fulfill contractual commitments, the president instructed his staff to deliver the defective lot. A cancer patient who had been maintained on the drug died shortly after beginning to take the defective pills. Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\\nA. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the presidentÕs conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\\nC. Yes, because distribution of the defective lot was only a regulatory offense.\\nD. Yes, because the cancer, not the presidentÕs conduct, was the proximate cause of death of the patient.\\nAnswer:', 'A victim and a defendant both worked as longshoremen at a shipyard. After the victim was shot to death, the defendant was tried for murder and acquitted. Following the acquittal, the victim\\'s estate sued the defendant in a wrongful death action. During the civil trial, the victim\\'s estate called a witness to testify. The witness, who worked with both men at the shipyard, testified that two weeks before the shooting, the victim came to work with a broken nose and said that the defendant had caused it. The attorney for the victim\\'s estate then asked the witness the following question, \"Was the defendant present during your conversation with the victim, and if so, did he say anything about the victim\\'s broken nose?\" The witness replied, \"Yes, the defendant was present, and after the victim told me that the defendant broke his nose, the defendant said, \\x80\\x98And that\\'s only the beginning. \"Upon objection by the defendant\\'s attorney, the witness\\'s testimony is\\nA. admissible, because it reports a declaration against interest.\\nB. admissible, because it reports the defendant\\'s adoptive admission of the victim\\'s assertion.\\nC. inadmissible, because of the principle of collateral estoppel.\\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\\nAnswer:', 'Joey has an orchard on the south part of town and recently found out that a sizable number of the trees are diseased.

The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple.

After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn\\'t it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We … discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month\\'s rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.… At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\\n—Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\\nA settlement house worker was most likely to be motivated by which of the following?\\nA.

      "retain prompts: ['The Native American Party was founded and chartered in a state to promote the political power of Native Americans. Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after a defeat in an election, the Party expelled all non- Native-American members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Native Americans could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party\\'s nominees. Membership is currently confined to Native Americans. In every election since, the Party\\'s nominees have easily won election in the Sixth Congressional District, an area encompassing a large number of outlying reservations. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own \"Native American Power\" candidate for governor of South Dakota in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U. S. representatives, governor, and U. S. senator before Party members for mail ballot, along with any rival candidates who qualify for the poll. A former non-Native American member of the Party is now challenging his exclusion from the Party. Which of the following constitutional provisions would furnish the former member\\'s best ground for challenging his exclusion from the Party?\\nA. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\nB. The right of assembly as guaranteed by the First Amendment.\\nC. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\nD. The voting provisions of the Twenty Fourth Amendment.\\nAnswer:', 'A painter working for a construction company was working with a group of construction co-workers on a house construction when a section of the house fell down on the owner. The painter declared, \"I knew they should have reinforced the standing wall better than they did! It is all their fault!\" It turned out that he was referring to co-workers employed by the same construction company. The owner filed suit for damages against the construction business. He tried to put the statement from the painter into evidence but the defendant objected. Will the court sustain the company\\'s objection to the admission of the painter\\'s statements?\\nA. Yes, because the painter is not qualified to make such statements regarding non-painting duties.\\nB. Yes, because the painter is not a participant as a negligent party in the catastrophic mistake that occurred.\\nC. No, because the painter works for the same company as the negligent workers, and he made his statements within the scope and course of his employment.\\nD. No, because the painter may testify as a subcontractor to what he observed while on the location.\\nAnswer:', 'A women\\'s action group attempted for many months, unsuccessfully, to reach an agreement with the local professional men\\'s club to admit women to membership. The women\\'s group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men\\'s club was subject to the state\\'s anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor\\'s office building, carrying signs that read, \"The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don\\'t vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney\\'s office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor\\'s official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:\"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the holding of a meeting or assembly on any premises used for the discussion of subjects of general public interest. \"The federal district court will most likely avoid making a decision on the merits of the suit for declaratory judgment because\\nA. the case lacks adequate ripeness.\\nB. there is no case or controversy.\\nC. the relief sought is essentially for an advisory opinion.\\nD. the women\\'s group lacks standing.\\nAnswer:', \"Some homeless people started residing on a strip of land located under a bridge. The land was owned by a nearby chemical manufacturer. The squatters did not ask permission, and the company did not feel it was an urgent problem. The squatters used a small lake on the property for bathing and drinking water. Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. The estates of the two decedents sued the company. Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?\\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\\nC. No, because owner owes no duty to trespassers except if it acts with willful or wanton disregard.\\nD. No, because an owner of land never has to worry about protecting the safety of trespassers.\\nAnswer:\", 'The president of a pharmaceutical firm received a report from his testing bureau that a manufactured lot of the firmÕs anticancer prescription medication was well below strength. Concerned about being able to fulfill contractual commitments, the president instructed his staff to deliver the defective lot. A cancer patient who had been maintained on the drug died shortly after beginning to take the defective pills. Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\\nA. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the presidentÕs conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\\nC. Yes, because distribution of the defective lot was only a regulatory offense.\\nD. Yes, because the cancer, not the presidentÕs conduct, was the proximate cause of death of the patient.\\nAnswer:', 'A victim and a defendant both worked as longshoremen at a shipyard. After the victim was shot to death, the defendant was tried for murder and acquitted. Following the acquittal, the victim\\'s estate sued the defendant in a wrongful death action. During the civil trial, the victim\\'s estate called a witness to testify. The witness, who worked with both men at the shipyard, testified that two weeks before the shooting, the victim came to work with a broken nose and said that the defendant had caused it. The attorney for the victim\\'s estate then asked the witness the following question, \"Was the defendant present during your conversation with the victim, and if so, did he say anything about the victim\\'s broken nose?\" The witness replied, \"Yes, the defendant was present, and after the victim told me that the defendant broke his nose, the defendant said, \\x80\\x98And that\\'s only the beginning. \"Upon objection by the defendant\\'s attorney, the witness\\'s testimony is\\nA. admissible, because it reports a declaration against interest.\\nB. admissible, because it reports the defendant\\'s adoptive admission of the victim\\'s assertion.\\nC. inadmissible, because of the principle of collateral estoppel.\\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\\nAnswer:', 'Joey has an orchard on the south part of town and recently found out that a sizable number of the trees are diseased.

Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\\nThe decline of the Roman Empire and that of its Chinese counterpart resulted in which of the following?\\nA.

Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after a defeat in an election, the Party expelled all non- Native-American members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Native Americans could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party\\'s nominees. Membership is currently confined to Native Americans. In every election since, the Party\\'s nominees have easily won election in the Sixth Congressional District, an area encompassing a large number of outlying reservations. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own \"Native American Power\" candidate for governor of South Dakota in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U.

He tried to put the statement from the painter into evidence but the defendant objected. Will the court sustain the company\\'s objection to the admission of the painter\\'s statements?\\nA. Yes, because the painter is not qualified to make such statements regarding non-painting duties.\\nB. Yes, because the painter is not a participant as a negligent party in the catastrophic mistake that occurred.\\nC. No, because the painter works for the same company as the negligent workers, and he made his statements within the scope and course of his employment.\\nD. No, because the painter may testify as a subcontractor to what he observed while on the location.\\nAnswer:', 'A women\\'s action group attempted for many months, unsuccessfully, to reach an agreement with the local professional men\\'s club to admit women to membership. The women\\'s group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men\\'s club was subject to the state\\'s anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor\\'s office building, carrying signs that read, \"The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don\\'t vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney\\'s office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor\\'s official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:\"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the holding of a meeting or assembly on any premises used for the discussion of subjects of general public interest. \"The federal district court will most likely avoid making a decision on the merits of the suit for declaratory judgment because\\nA. the case lacks adequate ripeness.\\nB. there is no case or controversy.\\nC. the relief sought is essentially for an advisory opinion.\\nD. the women\\'s group lacks standing.\\nAnswer:', \"Some homeless people started residing on a strip of land located under a bridge.

Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. The estates of the two decedents sued the company. Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?\\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\\nC. No, because owner owes no duty to trespassers except if it acts with willful or wanton disregard.\\nD.

Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\\nA. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the presidentÕs conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\\nC. Yes, because distribution of the defective lot was only a regulatory offense.\\nD.

The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple.

The women\\'s group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men\\'s club was subject to the state\\'s anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club.

Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance.

Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202.

Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\\nThe decline of the Roman Empire and that of its Chinese counterpart resulted in which of the following?\\nA.

Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party.

Membership is currently confined to Native Americans.

Yes, because the painter is not qualified to make such statements regarding non-painting duties.\\nB. Yes, because the painter is not a participant as a negligent party in the catastrophic mistake that occurred.\\nC.

The women\\'s group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men\\'s club was subject to the state\\'s anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor\\'s office building, carrying signs that read, \"The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don\\'t vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney\\'s office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor\\'s official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:\"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the holding of a meeting or assembly on any premises used for the discussion of subjects of general public interest. \"The federal district court will most likely avoid making a decision on the merits of the suit for declaratory judgment because\\nA. the case lacks adequate ripeness.\\nB. there is no case or controversy.\\nC. the relief sought is essentially for an advisory opinion.\\nD. the women\\'s group lacks standing.\\nAnswer:', \"Some homeless people started residing on a strip of land located under a bridge.

Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. The estates of the two decedents sued the company. Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?\\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\\nC.

Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\\nA. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the presidentÕs conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\\nC.

The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple.

The women\\'s group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men\\'s club was subject to the state\\'s anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor\\'s office building, carrying signs that read, \"The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don\\'t vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney\\'s office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor\\'s official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:\"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual.

The painter declared, \"I knew they should have reinforced the standing wall better than they did! It is all their fault!\" It turned out that he was referring to co-workers employed by the same construction company. The owner filed suit for damages against the construction business. He tried to put the statement from the painter into evidence but the defendant objected. Will the court sustain the company\\'s objection to the admission of the painter\\'s statements?\\nA. Yes, because the painter is not qualified to make such statements regarding non-painting duties.\\nB. Yes, because the painter is not a participant as a negligent party in the catastrophic mistake that occurred.\\nC. No, because the painter works for the same company as the negligent workers, and he made his statements within the scope and course of his employment.\\nD. No, because the painter may testify as a subcontractor to what he observed while on the location.\\nAnswer:', 'A women\\'s action group attempted for many months, unsuccessfully, to reach an agreement with the local professional men\\'s club to admit women to membership. The women\\'s group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men\\'s club was subject to the state\\'s anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor\\'s office building, carrying signs that read, \"The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don\\'t vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney\\'s office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor\\'s official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:\"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the holding of a meeting or assembly on any premises used for the discussion of subjects of general public interest. \"The federal district court will most likely avoid making a decision on the merits of the suit for declaratory judgment because\\nA. the case lacks adequate ripeness.\\nB. there is no case or controversy.\\nC. the relief sought is essentially for an advisory opinion.\\nD. the women\\'s group lacks standing.\\nAnswer:', \"Some homeless people started residing on a strip of land located under a bridge. The land was owned by a nearby chemical manufacturer. The squatters did not ask permission, and the company did not feel it was an urgent problem. The squatters used a small lake on the property for bathing and drinking water. Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. The estates of the two decedents sued the company. Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?\\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\\nC. No, because owner owes no duty to trespassers except if it acts with willful or wanton disregard.\\nD. No, because an owner of land never has to worry about protecting the safety of trespassers.\\nAnswer:\", 'The president of a pharmaceutical firm received a report from his testing bureau that a manufactured lot of the firmÕs anticancer prescription medication was well below strength. Concerned about being able to fulfill contractual commitments, the president instructed his staff to deliver the defective lot. A cancer patient who had been maintained on the drug died shortly after beginning to take the defective pills. Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\\nA. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the presidentÕs conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\\nC. Yes, because distribution of the defective lot was only a regulatory offense.\\nD. Yes, because the cancer, not the presidentÕs conduct, was the proximate cause of death of the patient.\\nAnswer:', 'A victim and a defendant both worked as longshoremen at a shipyard. After the victim was shot to death, the defendant was tried for murder and acquitted. Following the acquittal, the victim\\'s estate sued the defendant in a wrongful death action. During the civil trial, the victim\\'s estate called a witness to testify. The witness, who worked with both men at the shipyard, testified that two weeks before the shooting, the victim came to work with a broken nose and said that the defendant had caused it. The attorney for the victim\\'s estate then asked the witness the following question, \"Was the defendant present during your conversation with the victim, and if so, did he say anything about the victim\\'s broken nose?\" The witness replied, \"Yes, the defendant was present, and after the victim told me that the defendant broke his nose, the defendant said, \\x80\\x98And that\\'s only the beginning. \"Upon objection by the defendant\\'s attorney, the witness\\'s testimony is\\nA. admissible, because it reports a declaration against interest.\\nB. admissible, because it reports the defendant\\'s adoptive admission of the victim\\'s assertion.\\nC. inadmissible, because of the principle of collateral estoppel.\\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\\nAnswer:', 'Joey has an orchard on the south part of town and recently found out that a sizable number of the trees are diseased.

The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple.

After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn\\'t it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We … discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month\\'s rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.… At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\\n—Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\\nA settlement house worker was most likely to be motivated by which of the following?\\nA.

      "retain prompts: ['The Native American Party was founded and chartered in a state to promote the political power of Native Americans. Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after a defeat in an election, the Party expelled all non- Native-American members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Native Americans could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party\\'s nominees. Membership is currently confined to Native Americans. In every election since, the Party\\'s nominees have easily won election in the Sixth Congressional District, an area encompassing a large number of outlying reservations. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own \"Native American Power\" candidate for governor of South Dakota in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U. S. representatives, governor, and U. S. senator before Party members for mail ballot, along with any rival candidates who qualify for the poll. A former non-Native American member of the Party is now challenging his exclusion from the Party. Which of the following constitutional provisions would furnish the former member\\'s best ground for challenging his exclusion from the Party?\\nA. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\nB. The right of assembly as guaranteed by the First Amendment.\\nC. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\nD. The voting provisions of the Twenty Fourth Amendment.\\nAnswer:', 'A painter working for a construction company was working with a group of construction co-workers on a house construction when a section of the house fell down on the owner. The painter declared, \"I knew they should have reinforced the standing wall better than they did! It is all their fault!\" It turned out that he was referring to co-workers employed by the same construction company. The owner filed suit for damages against the construction business. He tried to put the statement from the painter into evidence but the defendant objected. Will the court sustain the company\\'s objection to the admission of the painter\\'s statements?\\nA. Yes, because the painter is not qualified to make such statements regarding non-painting duties.\\nB. Yes, because the painter is not a participant as a negligent party in the catastrophic mistake that occurred.\\nC. No, because the painter works for the same company as the negligent workers, and he made his statements within the scope and course of his employment.\\nD. No, because the painter may testify as a subcontractor to what he observed while on the location.\\nAnswer:', 'A women\\'s action group attempted for many months, unsuccessfully, to reach an agreement with the local professional men\\'s club to admit women to membership. The women\\'s group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men\\'s club was subject to the state\\'s anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor\\'s office building, carrying signs that read, \"The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don\\'t vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney\\'s office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor\\'s official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:\"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the holding of a meeting or assembly on any premises used for the discussion of subjects of general public interest. \"The federal district court will most likely avoid making a decision on the merits of the suit for declaratory judgment because\\nA. the case lacks adequate ripeness.\\nB. there is no case or controversy.\\nC. the relief sought is essentially for an advisory opinion.\\nD. the women\\'s group lacks standing.\\nAnswer:', \"Some homeless people started residing on a strip of land located under a bridge. The land was owned by a nearby chemical manufacturer. The squatters did not ask permission, and the company did not feel it was an urgent problem. The squatters used a small lake on the property for bathing and drinking water. Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. The estates of the two decedents sued the company. Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?\\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\\nC. No, because owner owes no duty to trespassers except if it acts with willful or wanton disregard.\\nD. No, because an owner of land never has to worry about protecting the safety of trespassers.\\nAnswer:\", 'The president of a pharmaceutical firm received a report from his testing bureau that a manufactured lot of the firmÕs anticancer prescription medication was well below strength. Concerned about being able to fulfill contractual commitments, the president instructed his staff to deliver the defective lot. A cancer patient who had been maintained on the drug died shortly after beginning to take the defective pills. Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\\nA. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the presidentÕs conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\\nC. Yes, because distribution of the defective lot was only a regulatory offense.\\nD. Yes, because the cancer, not the presidentÕs conduct, was the proximate cause of death of the patient.\\nAnswer:', 'A victim and a defendant both worked as longshoremen at a shipyard. After the victim was shot to death, the defendant was tried for murder and acquitted. Following the acquittal, the victim\\'s estate sued the defendant in a wrongful death action. During the civil trial, the victim\\'s estate called a witness to testify. The witness, who worked with both men at the shipyard, testified that two weeks before the shooting, the victim came to work with a broken nose and said that the defendant had caused it. The attorney for the victim\\'s estate then asked the witness the following question, \"Was the defendant present during your conversation with the victim, and if so, did he say anything about the victim\\'s broken nose?\" The witness replied, \"Yes, the defendant was present, and after the victim told me that the defendant broke his nose, the defendant said, \\x80\\x98And that\\'s only the beginning. \"Upon objection by the defendant\\'s attorney, the witness\\'s testimony is\\nA. admissible, because it reports a declaration against interest.\\nB. admissible, because it reports the defendant\\'s adoptive admission of the victim\\'s assertion.\\nC. inadmissible, because of the principle of collateral estoppel.\\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\\nAnswer:', 'Joey has an orchard on the south part of town and recently found out that a sizable number of the trees are diseased.

Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\\nThe decline of the Roman Empire and that of its Chinese counterpart resulted in which of the following?\\nA.

Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after a defeat in an election, the Party expelled all non- Native-American members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Native Americans could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party\\'s nominees. Membership is currently confined to Native Americans. In every election since, the Party\\'s nominees have easily won election in the Sixth Congressional District, an area encompassing a large number of outlying reservations. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own \"Native American Power\" candidate for governor of South Dakota in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U.

He tried to put the statement from the painter into evidence but the defendant objected. Will the court sustain the company\\'s objection to the admission of the painter\\'s statements?\\nA. Yes, because the painter is not qualified to make such statements regarding non-painting duties.\\nB. Yes, because the painter is not a participant as a negligent party in the catastrophic mistake that occurred.\\nC. No, because the painter works for the same company as the negligent workers, and he made his statements within the scope and course of his employment.\\nD. No, because the painter may testify as a subcontractor to what he observed while on the location.\\nAnswer:', 'A women\\'s action group attempted for many months, unsuccessfully, to reach an agreement with the local professional men\\'s club to admit women to membership. The women\\'s group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men\\'s club was subject to the state\\'s anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor\\'s office building, carrying signs that read, \"The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don\\'t vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney\\'s office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor\\'s official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:\"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the holding of a meeting or assembly on any premises used for the discussion of subjects of general public interest. \"The federal district court will most likely avoid making a decision on the merits of the suit for declaratory judgment because\\nA. the case lacks adequate ripeness.\\nB. there is no case or controversy.\\nC. the relief sought is essentially for an advisory opinion.\\nD. the women\\'s group lacks standing.\\nAnswer:', \"Some homeless people started residing on a strip of land located under a bridge.

Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. The estates of the two decedents sued the company. Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?\\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\\nC. No, because owner owes no duty to trespassers except if it acts with willful or wanton disregard.\\nD.

Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\\nA. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the presidentÕs conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\\nC. Yes, because distribution of the defective lot was only a regulatory offense.\\nD.

Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\\nThe decline of the Roman Empire and that of its Chinese counterpart resulted in which of the following?\\nA.

Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after a defeat in an election, the Party expelled all non- Native-American members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Native Americans could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party\\'s nominees. Membership is currently confined to Native Americans. In every election since, the Party\\'s nominees have easily won election in the Sixth Congressional District, an area encompassing a large number of outlying reservations.

Yes, because the painter is not qualified to make such statements regarding non-painting duties.\\nB. Yes, because the painter is not a participant as a negligent party in the catastrophic mistake that occurred.\\nC.

The women\\'s group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men\\'s club was subject to the state\\'s anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor\\'s office building, carrying signs that read, \"The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don\\'t vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney\\'s office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor\\'s official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:\"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual.

Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. The estates of the two decedents sued the company. Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?\\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\\nC.

Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder.

No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the presidentÕs conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\\nC.

The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\\nThe decline of the Roman Empire and that of its Chinese counterpart resulted in which of the following?\\nA.

Yes, because the painter is not qualified to make such statements regarding non-painting duties.\\nB.

The women\\'s group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men\\'s club was subject to the state\\'s anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor\\'s office building, carrying signs that read, \"The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don\\'t vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney\\'s office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor\\'s official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:\"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the holding of a meeting or assembly on any premises used for the discussion of subjects of general public interest. \"The federal district court will most likely avoid making a decision on the merits of the suit for declaratory judgment because\\nA. the case lacks adequate ripeness.\\nB. there is no case or controversy.\\nC. the relief sought is essentially for an advisory opinion.\\nD. the women\\'s group lacks standing.\\nAnswer:', \"Some homeless people started residing on a strip of land located under a bridge.

Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\\nC.

No, because the jury could have found that the presidentÕs conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\\nC.

The land was owned by a nearby chemical manufacturer. The squatters did not ask permission, and the company did not feel it was an urgent problem. The squatters used a small lake on the property for bathing and drinking water. Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. The estates of the two decedents sued the company. Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?\\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\\nC. No, because owner owes no duty to trespassers except if it acts with willful or wanton disregard.\\nD. No, because an owner of land never has to worry about protecting the safety of trespassers.\\nAnswer:\", 'The president of a pharmaceutical firm received a report from his testing bureau that a manufactured lot of the firmÕs anticancer prescription medication was well below strength.

Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\\nA. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the presidentÕs conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\\nC. Yes, because distribution of the defective lot was only a regulatory offense.\\nD. Yes, because the cancer, not the presidentÕs conduct, was the proximate cause of death of the patient.\\nAnswer:', 'A victim and a defendant both worked as longshoremen at a shipyard. After the victim was shot to death, the defendant was tried for murder and acquitted. Following the acquittal, the victim\\'s estate sued the defendant in a wrongful death action.

      "retain prompts: ['The Native American Party was founded and chartered in a state to promote the political power of Native Americans. Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after a defeat in an election, the Party expelled all non- Native-American members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Native Americans could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party\\'s nominees. Membership is currently confined to Native Americans. In every election since, the Party\\'s nominees have easily won election in the Sixth Congressional District, an area encompassing a large number of outlying reservations. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own \"Native American Power\" candidate for governor of South Dakota in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U. S. representatives, governor, and U. S. senator before Party members for mail ballot, along with any rival candidates who qualify for the poll. A former non-Native American member of the Party is now challenging his exclusion from the Party. Which of the following constitutional provisions would furnish the former member\\'s best ground for challenging his exclusion from the Party?\\nA. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\nB. The right of assembly as guaranteed by the First Amendment.\\nC. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\nD. The voting provisions of the Twenty Fourth Amendment.\\nAnswer:', 'A painter working for a construction company was working with a group of construction co-workers on a house construction when a section of the house fell down on the owner. The painter declared, \"I knew they should have reinforced the standing wall better than they did! It is all their fault!\" It turned out that he was referring to co-workers employed by the same construction company. The owner filed suit for damages against the construction business. He tried to put the statement from the painter into evidence but the defendant objected. Will the court sustain the company\\'s objection to the admission of the painter\\'s statements?\\nA. Yes, because the painter is not qualified to make such statements regarding non-painting duties.\\nB. Yes, because the painter is not a participant as a negligent party in the catastrophic mistake that occurred.\\nC. No, because the painter works for the same company as the negligent workers, and he made his statements within the scope and course of his employment.\\nD. No, because the painter may testify as a subcontractor to what he observed while on the location.\\nAnswer:', 'A women\\'s action group attempted for many months, unsuccessfully, to reach an agreement with the local professional men\\'s club to admit women to membership. The women\\'s group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men\\'s club was subject to the state\\'s anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor\\'s office building, carrying signs that read, \"The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don\\'t vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney\\'s office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor\\'s official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:\"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the holding of a meeting or assembly on any premises used for the discussion of subjects of general public interest. \"The federal district court will most likely avoid making a decision on the merits of the suit for declaratory judgment because\\nA. the case lacks adequate ripeness.\\nB. there is no case or controversy.\\nC. the relief sought is essentially for an advisory opinion.\\nD. the women\\'s group lacks standing.\\nAnswer:', \"Some homeless people started residing on a strip of land located under a bridge. The land was owned by a nearby chemical manufacturer. The squatters did not ask permission, and the company did not feel it was an urgent problem. The squatters used a small lake on the property for bathing and drinking water. Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. The estates of the two decedents sued the company. Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?\\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\\nC. No, because owner owes no duty to trespassers except if it acts with willful or wanton disregard.\\nD. No, because an owner of land never has to worry about protecting the safety of trespassers.\\nAnswer:\", 'The president of a pharmaceutical firm received a report from his testing bureau that a manufactured lot of the firmÕs anticancer prescription medication was well below strength. Concerned about being able to fulfill contractual commitments, the president instructed his staff to deliver the defective lot. A cancer patient who had been maintained on the drug died shortly after beginning to take the defective pills. Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\\nA. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the presidentÕs conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\\nC. Yes, because distribution of the defective lot was only a regulatory offense.\\nD. Yes, because the cancer, not the presidentÕs conduct, was the proximate cause of death of the patient.\\nAnswer:', 'A victim and a defendant both worked as longshoremen at a shipyard. After the victim was shot to death, the defendant was tried for murder and acquitted. Following the acquittal, the victim\\'s estate sued the defendant in a wrongful death action. During the civil trial, the victim\\'s estate called a witness to testify. The witness, who worked with both men at the shipyard, testified that two weeks before the shooting, the victim came to work with a broken nose and said that the defendant had caused it. The attorney for the victim\\'s estate then asked the witness the following question, \"Was the defendant present during your conversation with the victim, and if so, did he say anything about the victim\\'s broken nose?\" The witness replied, \"Yes, the defendant was present, and after the victim told me that the defendant broke his nose, the defendant said, \\x80\\x98And that\\'s only the beginning. \"Upon objection by the defendant\\'s attorney, the witness\\'s testimony is\\nA. admissible, because it reports a declaration against interest.\\nB. admissible, because it reports the defendant\\'s adoptive admission of the victim\\'s assertion.\\nC. inadmissible, because of the principle of collateral estoppel.\\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\\nAnswer:', 'Joey has an orchard on the south part of town and recently found out that a sizable number of the trees are diseased.

Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\\nThe decline of the Roman Empire and that of its Chinese counterpart resulted in which of the following?\\nA.

Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after a defeat in an election, the Party expelled all non- Native-American members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Native Americans could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party\\'s nominees. Membership is currently confined to Native Americans. In every election since, the Party\\'s nominees have easily won election in the Sixth Congressional District, an area encompassing a large number of outlying reservations. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own \"Native American Power\" candidate for governor of South Dakota in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U.

He tried to put the statement from the painter into evidence but the defendant objected. Will the court sustain the company\\'s objection to the admission of the painter\\'s statements?\\nA. Yes, because the painter is not qualified to make such statements regarding non-painting duties.\\nB. Yes, because the painter is not a participant as a negligent party in the catastrophic mistake that occurred.\\nC. No, because the painter works for the same company as the negligent workers, and he made his statements within the scope and course of his employment.\\nD.

The women\\'s group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men\\'s club was subject to the state\\'s anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor\\'s office building, carrying signs that read, \"The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don\\'t vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney\\'s office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor\\'s official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:\"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual.

Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. The estates of the two decedents sued the company. Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?\\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\\nC. No, because owner owes no duty to trespassers except if it acts with willful or wanton disregard.\\nD.

Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\\nA. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the presidentÕs conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\\nC.

The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple.

Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club.

Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance.

Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202.

Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\\nThe decline of the Roman Empire and that of its Chinese counterpart resulted in which of the following?\\nA.

Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after a defeat in an election, the Party expelled all non- Native-American members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Native Americans could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party\\'s nominees. Membership is currently confined to Native Americans. In every election since, the Party\\'s nominees have easily won election in the Sixth Congressional District, an area encompassing a large number of outlying reservations.

He tried to put the statement from the painter into evidence but the defendant objected. Will the court sustain the company\\'s objection to the admission of the painter\\'s statements?\\nA. Yes, because the painter is not qualified to make such statements regarding non-painting duties.\\nB. Yes, because the painter is not a participant as a negligent party in the catastrophic mistake that occurred.\\nC. No, because the painter works for the same company as the negligent workers, and he made his statements within the scope and course of his employment.\\nD.

The women\\'s group instituted a suit for a declaratory judgment in federal court to determine whether the men\\'s club was subject to the state\\'s anti-discrimination act. Prior to the elections for city officials, four members of the women\\'s group were sent to picket the offices of the mayor and district attorney, both prominent members of the men\\'s club. Two members walked outside the front of the mayor\\'s office building, carrying signs that read, \"The mayor is supposed to serve all the people but his lunch club is for men ONLY. So don\\'t vote for him. \" The other two pickets walked outside the rear of the district attorney\\'s office building, carrying similar signs, telling the public not to vote for him. This picketing was carried on from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. The same day, two more pickets were assigned to carry identical signs in front of the mayor\\'s official residence. Two pickets also carried duplicate signs in front of the district attorney\\'s suburban home during the early evening hours. The picketing at all sites was held peacefully without any disturbance. The relevant city ordinances concerning picketing read as follows:\"Section 201. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to, city hall, without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. Section 202. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the holding of a meeting or assembly on any premises used for the discussion of subjects of general public interest. \"The federal district court will most likely avoid making a decision on the merits of the suit for declaratory judgment because\\nA. the case lacks adequate ripeness.\\nB. there is no case or controversy.\\nC. the relief sought is essentially for an advisory opinion.\\nD. the women\\'s group lacks standing.\\nAnswer:', \"Some homeless people started residing on a strip of land located under a bridge.

Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. The estates of the two decedents sued the company. Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?\\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\\nC.

Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\\nA. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the presidentÕs conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\\nC.

Increase in US military capability\\nD. Increase in US international influence\\nAnswer:\", 'In what ways has human security been significant as a concept?\\nA. Human security has put particular emphasis on the nexus between conflict and development, a concept which is very useful. The significance of the nexus between development and conflict is not just that it raises ethical issues about human suffering and inequalities, but that its frequent outcomes, so called state future, has dire local, regional, and global effects.\\nB. From a normative perspective, the concept serves to highlight good global norms. Human security often serves as an umbrella norm. Developing good global norms is not only important for moral and ethical reasons but also because they serve to enhance state and international society.\\nC. The development of the human security concept highlights the view that the threats to humans as well as to state entities are changing and increasing. These changes have spurred debates about the meaning of security and the arguments for its broadening and deepening. Like internal violence, these transnational issues have serious local, regional, and global effects.\\nD. All of these options.\\nAnswer:', \"Which of the following generally results when the Senate and House of Representatives pass different versions of the same bill?\\nA.
